Filling

### Ingredients

* 4 Cups ground pistachios
* 1 Cup sugar
* 1 Tbsp cinnamon
* 4 Tbsp light vegetable oil
* Cooking spray
* Some Phyllo dough, see above

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease two 8-inch baking pans.
2. Put nuts, sugar and cinnamon into a food processor. Pulse until nuts are finely ground with just a bit of texture.
3. Cut phyllo dough into 6 equal pieces. Wrap all but the piece you are working with in plastic wrap. 
  * Roll out one piece at a time, as thinly as possible, between two sheets of plastic wrap about 16" long. 
  * Remove top piece of plastic wrap. Carefully fit dough into one of pans. The piece should be large enough so that it fits up the sides and hangs over a bit. 
  * Roll out a second piece of dough the same way and fit it into the other pan. 
  * Sprinkle 1 Cup of ground nuts over the dough in each pan. 
  * Roll out two more pieces of phyllo and carefully lay over the filling. 
  * Sprinkle another cup of filling over the second layer of each pan. 
  * Roll out last two pieces of phyllo and carefully cover the layer of nuts. 
  * Trim edges that are hanging over the sides of pan. Leave enough to roll under to form an edge.
4. Using a sharp paring knife, score the top of baklava. Cut into 1 1/2" lengths. Then cut 1 1/2" widths wide, starting from one of the corners diagonally to the opposite corner to create and diamond shape.
5. Drizzle 2 Tbsp of oil over scoring of each baklava.
6. Bake for 30 minutes or until baklava is golden. Make syrup while baklava is baking.
