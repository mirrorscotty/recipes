* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* Lukewarm water by the half-teaspoonful, as necessary

###Whipped Cream Cheese Filling
* 1 cup (8 fluid ounces) heavy whipping cream, chilled
* 1/2 cup (58 g) confectioners’ sugar
* 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions
----------
Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a 12-inch pizza pan (or large baking sheet)
with unbleached parchment paper and set it aside.

###First, make the cookie dough
In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum,
baking powder, salt, granulated sugar and confectioners’ sugar, and whisk to
combine well. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the
butter, egg and vanilla, mixing to combine after each addition. The dough
should come together and be thick but not stiff. If it is stiff, add water
by the quarter teaspoonful, mixing to combine after each addition, until the
dough reaches the proper consistency.

###Shape and bake the crust
Place the cookie dough between two sheets of
unbleached parchment paper and roll it out into a round about 3/8-inch thick
and about 11-inches in diameter. If your pizza pan is smaller, trim the
circle to fit the pan. Place the shaped dough on the prepared pizza pan or
baking sheet, and place it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer
for less than 10 minutes to chill until firm. Remove the top sheet of parchment
paper and place the pan in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 8 to 10
minutes, or until the crust is very lightly golden brown on the underside and
set all the way to the center. Remove from the oven and allow the crust to cool
completely on the pan. The cookie crust can be made days (or even weeks) ahead
of time, cooled, and then wrapped tightly and frozen. Defrost at room
temperature and continue with the recipe.

###Make the filling
Transfer 2 tablespoons of the cream to a small bowl and set
it aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a
large bowl with a handheld mixer, place the remaining cream and beat on medium-
high speed until soft peaks form. Add the confectioners’ sugar, and continue to
beat until stiff, glossy peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a separate,
large bowl and place in the refrigerator to chill. In the same bowl, place the
cream cheese, vanilla, salt and reserved 2 tablespoons cream. With the whisk
attachment, whip the cream cheese mixture on medium-high speed until light and
fluffy. Remove the whipped cream from the refrigerator and add half of the
whipped cream mixture to the cream cheese mixture, and whisk to combine. Add
the remaining whipped cream, and fold it into the filling carefully until
combined.

###Assemble the pizza
Place the filling on top of the cooled cookie crust, and
spread into an even layer. Decorate the top with the fruit in whatever pattern
you like. Slice and serve immediately, or, for a cleaner slice, place the
assembled fruit pizza in the refrigerator for about an hour to allow the
filling to set.
