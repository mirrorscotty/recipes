Chocolate Chip Cookies
======================

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 1/2 cups of butter (this equals 3 sticks)
* 4 eggs
* 1 cups brown sugar
* 1 cup white sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla. (_see note 1_)
* 4 cups of rice flour-brown or white. (_see note 2_)
* 1 1/2 cups tapioca flour.
* 2 teaspoons of baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 to 3 packages of chocolate chips.

Directions
----------
1. Put all the wet ingredients into the mixing bowl. Cream the ingredients together at low to medium speed until smooth. 
2. Add dry ingredients and mix. 
    * Add tablespoons of water to moisten mixture if it is too dry and crumbly. 
3. Stir in chocolate chips (_see note 3_). 
4. Bake at 350&deg;F for 8 minutes, or until golden.
5. The cookies will look golden in the oven when done, but will still look puffy and soft. Remove them from the oven, and let them cool for 5 minutes. 
   * The cookies should firm up, and you can remove them from the pan.
 
 Notes
 -----
 1. McCormick's vanilla is gluten free, as are others sold in health food stores.
 2. This is basically one package of rice flour.
 3. You can use a mixer here if it can handle the load, or stir by hand.
