Rosemary and Lemon Shortbread Cookies
=====================================

Ingredients
-----------
* ½ cup butter, room temperature
* 3 tbsp honey
* 1 ½ cup gluten free flour
* 1 tsp rosemary, finely minced
* ½ tsp lemon zest
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* ½ tsp salt 

Directions
----------
1. Cream together the honey and butter. You can use a food processor or hand
    blender. I personally like to hand mix because there’s less mess and your
    arm gets a mini workout!

2. Add lemon juice, zest, and rosemary and mix well. Slowly add flour to the
    bowl, cutting with a fork until you have a doughy mixture.

3. Roll cookie dough into small cylinders and wrap in parchment or wax paper.
    Chill in the fridge for up to an hour or until the dough is firm.

4. After an hour, slice the cookies off the roll about half an inch in width. If
    you want, you can cook the whole batch or save a portion of the raw cookie
    dough in the freezer for another time. Make sure it's sealed tight to avoid
    freezer burn.

5. Place cookies on a baking sheet an inch apart from each other. Bake at 325
    degrees for around 10-15 minutes or until the edges begin to brown. If
    you’re not sure, gently lift one of the cookies off the sheet with a
    spatula and check the bottom. If the cookie bottoms have a deep golden
    brown colour, they’re ready.

6. Let cool on the sheet for a few minutes and enjoy!
