--------
Yield: 1 pie crust (weren't expecting that, were ya?)

Ingredients
------------
* 350 grams Aherns’ all-purpose flour (_see note 1_)
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 230 grams (2 US sticks) unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup ice-cold water, plus a few splashes more

Directions
----------
1. Cut the butter into one-inch cubes. Put them in the freezer for 15 minutes.
2. Put the flour and salt into a large food processor. Pulse them together until the flour is fluffy and aerated.
3. Add the butter cubes. Pulse ten times. At this point, the flour and butter should look like a sandy mixture, with the butter chunks still visible.
4. Pour in the ½ cup of ice-cold water. Pulse five times. Look at the dough. If it still looks a bit dry, add a splash more water, not exceeding another ¼ cup. The finished dough should like curds of dry cottage cheese. Stop adding water.
5. Dump the dough onto a clean, cool surface.
6. Gently gather all the dough together in your hands. 
7. Working quickly, take half the dough, make it into a ball, then flatten it into a plump disk, about 2 inches tall.
8. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (_see note 2_). Do the same with the remaining dough.

Notes
-----
1. Gluten Free "All-Purpose" Flour can be made by mixing the following together:
   * 200 grams superfine brown rice flour
   * 150 grams sorghum flour
   * 50 grams potato flour
   * 250 grams sweet rice flour
   * 150 grams potato starch
   * 100 grams arrowroot powder
   * 100 grams cornstarch
2. Now let’s be honest here. If you want, you could roll out the dough immediately. Sure, the dough is better when you let it rest, because the flours hydrate more fully. But if you’re in a rush, you can roll out the dough immediately, if you work quickly.
