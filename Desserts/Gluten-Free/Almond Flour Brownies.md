4. Beat together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla
5. Slowly pour the slightly cooled melted chocolate and butter into the egg/sugar mixture while mixing until fully incorporated. 
    * Don’t add too fast so that the raw eggs don’t cook upon contact.
6. Add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture and mix completely.
7. Pour the batter in a sprayed 8 x 8 pan (_see note 2_)
8. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips and gently press it into the batter.
9. Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.
10. Cool completely and devour!

Notes
-----
1. Sugar can be replaced with 1/3 cup Stevia
2. Coconut oil is recommended, but most oils will work
