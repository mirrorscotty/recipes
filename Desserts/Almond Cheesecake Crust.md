Ingredients
-----------
* 1 cup almond meal
* 1/2 cup crushed slivered almonds
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 3 tbsp melted butter

Directions
----------
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

2. Whisk almond meal, slivered almonds, 1/4 cup sugar, baking soda, and 1/4
teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in butter until almond mixture is
evenly moistened. Pour almond mixture into a 10-inch springform pan and press
firmly into the bottom.

3. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, about 10 minutes. Remove crust
from oven and reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a pan
of hot water onto the bottom rack of the oven to help reduce cracking in the
cheesecake.
