Salmon with Garlic and Tumeric
==============================

Source: _660 Curries_ by Raghavan Iyer

Ingredients
-----------
* 1.5 tsp coarse kosher salt
* 1 tsp ground tumeric
* 6 medium-sized cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 1 lb boneless, skinless salmon fillet
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 0.5 cup unsweetened coconut milk
* 0.5 tsp black peppercorns coarsely crushed
* 2 fresh green Thai or serrano chiles, stems removed, cut in half lengthwise (do not remove seeds)

Directions
----------
1. Mix the salt, tumeric, and garlic together in a small bowl. Sprinkle this
rub over the top of the salmon fillet and rub it in. Refrigerate the fish,
covered, for at least 30 minutes or as long as overnight, to allow the flavors
to permeate the flesh.

2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon,
spice-covered side down, and sear it for about 2 minutes (this will brown the
fish and the garlic in the rub, and also cook the tumeric). Turn the fillet
over and sear the underside until browned about 2 minutes.

3. Measure out the cocout milk in a measuring cup, and add the peppercorns and
the chiles. Stir and pour this over the fish. Lift the fillet with a spatula
and tild the skillet slightly to allow the spiced coconut milk to run under it
and release the browned bits of garlic, spice, and fish. Reduce the heat to
medium-low, cover the skillet, and braise the salmon, spooning the sauce over
it occasionally, until the fish is barely starting to flake, 3-5 minutes.

4. Transfer the fish to a platter, pour the curry over it and serve.

Notes
-----
1. Shrimp or scallops make an excellent alternative to the salmon, as it does any firm-fleshed fish like cod, bass, or catfish. Farm-raised tilapia is also a palatable option.
2. The two sources of heat in this curry, chiles and peppercorns, should not deter you from trying this recipe -- they exude a hushed presence in the unsweetened coconut milk. The fresh chiles are slit open to reveal the vein that harbors the potent capsaicin, but since they are not chopped, they will generate less heat.
