Total Yield: 2 boules or 4 baguettes (or some combination)

Total Time: 1:00
* Prep Time: 0:20
* Cook Time: 0:40

Special Equpiment
-----------------
* Kitchen Scale (_see note 1_)
* Oven Proof Pot (cast iron preferred) with Lid, Alternatively a Canning Kettle
* Slightly smaller bowl than above.

Ingredients
-----------
* 150 grams potato starch
* 150 grams tapioca flour
* 140 grams sorghum flour
* 35 grams sweet rice flour
* 30 grams sugar
* 10 grams salt
* 20 grams xanthan gum
* 10 grams guar gum

Instructions
------------
1. Add 1500 grams of cultured sourdough starter (hooch stirred in) and 1/2 cup of water. (_see note 2_)
2. Beat together for 5 minutes on high in a stand mixer to create the bubble structure for the bread.
   * You will be able to see the bread change from a mass of soft dough to one with a bit of bounce.
   * The dough will create a effect of strands on the bowl sides then gather on the beater.
   
### Boule Instructions
1. Place ½ bread dough on a square of parchment paper using a spatula to smooth and shape the dough into a ball.
2. Repeat with the second half of the dough or follow the below instructions to create 2 baguettes.
3. Lift the paper holding the ball and place it into the bowl a bit smaller than your pot to rise. Nestle the second ball along side.
4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place into oven with oven light on but no heat.
5. Let rise for 4 hours or till doubled (_see note 3_).
6. Bring the bread to room temp while preheating your pot and oven.
7. Remove the dough balls from the bowl using the paper as a lifting aid.
8. Cut slashes 1 inch into each loaf using your sharpest knife, a razor blade or if you own one a lame.
    * Be decorative, these are the areas of lighter white that you see on artisan loaves (_see note 4_).  
    * These slashes will allow for oven rise, the extra lift that happens as the bread is put into a hot oven.
9. Put your pot into the oven and preheat both to 450 degrees.
10. When the oven is fully preheated, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Watch out, this is where it is easy to burn you!
11. Remove the lid, then lift the bread dough into the pot, using the paper as a lifting aid.
12. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt if desired, replace the cover.
13. Put the pot into the oven and set your timer for 35 minutes.
14. When the timer goes off, use the instant read to check the internal temperature of the bread. It should be 190-200 degrees when done.
15. If the bread is fully browned, just put it on a cooling rack. If it could use just a bit more browning, remove the bread from the pot (again using the paper as a lifting aid) and place on the oven rack for 5 minutes more.

### Baguette Instructions
1. With half the dough, form into 2 baguettes.
2. Use a piece of parchment paper or silpat sprinkled with sweet rice flour since it gives a crisp crust, but you can use millet too for a softer crust.
3. Taking one half of the dough you have (1/4 of the total dough) place it on the parchment paper in a long log.
4. Sprinkle with a bit more sweet rice flour. Using the paper, extend and roll the bread dough into a long baguette shape. 
   * The dough won’t allow you to handle it like regular bread, it is just too soft. Let the paper do the work of rolling and extending.
5. Roll it onto your parchment paper covered
6. Pull out a long piece of plastic wrap and use it to wrap the entire baguette pan to hold in the moisture while rising.
7. Let rise at room temperature 4 hours or till doubled (_see notes 3 and 5_).
8. Bring the bread to room temperature before continuing.
9. Once you have the plastic wrap off of the pan, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
10. Using a pastry brush spread a bit of water on the bread. Don’t soak it but get it good and damp.
    * The combination of hot oven and damp dough creates a dense, crisp crust.
11. Slash 3-4 evenly spaced diagonal slashes on the baguette using your sharpest knife, a razor blade or lame to ensure a good place for the oven rise to occur.
12. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
13. Once ready, put in the baguette pan and let bake for 15 minutes.
14. Reduce heat to 400 degrees, rotate the pan and continue to bake for 15 minutes more before checking the temperature of the bread.
15. Temp on instant read thermometer should be 190-200 degrees. If the baguettes are brown enough, remove and cool. If not, keep them in the oven for 5 minutes more.

Notes
-----
1. Accurate measurements are very important to this recipe, and also allow for using only a single bowl.
2. I sometimes use a bit more water when I want a tender thread but you have to monitor the loaf more to make sure it comes out well. At ½ cup, it always does.
3. If you want to be able to walk away for a bit longer, just pop the bread in the fridge instead. It can rise there as long as 12 hours.
4. I typically slash two parallel lines on either side of the ball, turn the loaf 90 degrees and slash two more parallel lines to form a square on the top of the loaf.
5. In my cold kitchen in winter, it can take up to 6 hours if I don’t put it in the oven with the oven light on but without any additional heat.
