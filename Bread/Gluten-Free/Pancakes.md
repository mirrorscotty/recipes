Gluten-Free Pancakes
====================

Metadata
--------
Yield: 10 to 12 Pancakes.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 cup rice flour
* 1/2 cup tapioca flour
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon gluten free baking powder (_see note 1_)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (_see note 1_)
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup half and half (_see note 2_)
* 1/2 cup water

Directions
----------
1. Mix dry ingredients. 
2. Add eggs, and stir. 
3. Add half and half and water, stir until well mixed. The batter should be well blended, but will still have some lumps. It should be a little thick, but liquid enough to pour.
   * If the batter is too thin, add a bit of rice flour. 
   * If the batter is too thick, add some water-just a bit at a time. 
4. Spray skillet with non-stick cooking spray. Place skillet over medium heat. 
5. Use a soup ladle to pour batter into skillet. 
6. Turn pancakes when the batter starts to bubble on the top.

Notes
-----
1. These items are available at a health food store.
2. Instead of half and half, milk can be used in the same quantity.
