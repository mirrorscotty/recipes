Total Time: 2:45
* Prep: 0:20
* Inactive: 1:30
* Cook: 0:55
* Additional (non-calculated): 8-15 hours refrigerated

Equipment
---------
* Small and Large mixing bowl _see note 3_
* Lightly floured kneading surface
* 9 x 5 inch loaf pan
* Wooden Spoon
* Cooling Rack
* Pastry Brush

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 envelope Active Dry Yeast (= 2 1/4 teaspoons or 1/4 ounce)
* 11 ounces Bread Flour, plus extra
* 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon **toasted** uncooked rolled oats (divided)
* 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
* 12 ounces Cooked Rolled Oats _see note 1_
* 1/4 cup warm water
* 2 tablespoons agave syrup _see note 2_
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1 tablespoon water

Directions
----------
1. Combine yeast, bread flour, 1/4 cup toasted oats, and salt in a small mixing bowl and set aside.
2. Combine cooked oatmeal, warm water, agave syrup, and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large mixing bowl (_see note 3_).
3. Add the dry mixture to the cooked oatmeal mixture in 3 parts, and mix throughly with a wooden spoon after each part.
4. Turn the dough to a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for 10 minutes or so, incorporating more flour if necessary.
   * Dough will be sticky
5. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl or container, cover with plastic wrap, and set in warm place to rise until dough has doubled in size, about an hour.
6. Punch down the dough, shape into a loaf, and put into a lightly oiled loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8-15 hours (overnight).
7. Preheat oven to 350 &deg;F.
8. Combine egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. 
9. Lightly brush the top of the loaf with the egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon toasted oats.
10. Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 210 &deg;F.
   * This will take 55 minutes to an hour. If you don't have one, just bake for an hour.
11. Remove loaf from the pan and place on a cooling rack for 30 minutes. Ready to serve.

Storage
-------
For most breads, I generally cover with a towel and leave them on a cutting board, however the cut end will get stale fairly quickly.
To alleviate this, you can store the loaf with the cut end down on a ceramic (or similar) plate, which will keep it from getting stale for a day or two.
The bread is best immediately after baking, but is edible as bread for about a week. Beyond that, it's too stale to eat as bread, but can be cut into crutons for another few days.

Notes
-----
1. If not making oatmeal (which really, who does anymore?), make 1 cup's worth, following the package directions. If you don't have the package:
   * Bring 2 parts water and a pinch of salt to rolling boil
   * Add 1 part oatmeal
   * Cover, cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally
   * Remove from heat and continue making bread.
2. I've also used 2 tablespoons of honey, which worked nicely. Not sure which I liked better.
3. Alternatively, save yourself the dish to clean and use the pan you made the oatmeal in instead of a large mixing bowl. The extra heat doesn't effect anything enough to matter, if you're sufficiently fast.
