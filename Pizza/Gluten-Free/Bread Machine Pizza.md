-----------
* 1 2/3 cups warm water
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 2 eggs
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

2. Add flours and other dry ingredients. 
3. Make a well in the top of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast into it. 
4. Set the machine for its dough cycle. 
5. As the machine goes through its first mixing cycle, use a rubber scrapper to scrape the sides of the container to ensure all the flour is mixed in.
6. Once the dough is done, spread a thin layer of corn meal (yellow or white) onto a pizza stone. 
7, Pour the dough (it will be thin and sticky) onto the stone. Use a spoon to clean out the bread machine. 
8. Pour some olive oil into a small bowl and coat your hands. 
9. Push the pizza dough out to the edges of the pizza stone, re-coating your hands as necessary.
10. Once the dough is ready, spread tomato puree over the top. Sprinkle this with Italian seasonings. 
11. Spread one 4 cup package of shredded mozzarella cheese over the top. 
12. Add toppings such as olives (one small can, drained), pepperoni (Hormel is gluten-free), and perhaps diced onions. 
13. Bake at 400 &deg;F for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust edges are golden brown. 
14. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut and enjoy!
