Total Yield: 1 pizza's worth of dough

Total Time: 0:50
* Prep: 0:30
* Cook: 0:20

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or as needed)
* 1 envelope active dry yeast
* 1 cup very warm water (120 &deg;F to 130 &deg;F), 1/4 cup seperated
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Some cornmeal for the pan

Directions
----------
1. Place 1/4 cup warm water in large bowl, sprinkle with yeast and stir until dissolved
2. Add remaining water, salt, oil, and 2 cups of all-purpose flour; stir well.
3. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough
4. Knead on lightly floured surface (__see note 1__) until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes.
5. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 to 60 minutes.
6. Punch down and move dough to lightly floured surface.
7. Lightly oil pizza pan and sprinkle with cornmeal.
8. Shape dough into smooth ball, and roll and shape to fit pan. Top as desired.
9. Bake at 400 &deg;F for 20 to 30 minutes or until done. Baking time depends on size and thickness of crust and toppings.

Notes
-----
1. I generally knead in the bowl I stired it together in. Not 100% correct, but it works well enough.
2. You can mix in 2 teaspoons of Basil, Oregano, or Rosemary and 1 clove of finely minced garlic with the dry ingredients to make garlic her pizza dough.
3. You can replace 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour with cornmeal for cornmeal pizza dough.
4. You can replace 1 cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for whole wheat pizza dough.
