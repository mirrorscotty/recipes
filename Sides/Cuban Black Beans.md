Ingredients
-----------
* 4 Cans black beans undrained
* 1 Medium Sweet Onion
* 2 Medium red peppers
* 3 Packets Goya Sazon (_see note 1_)(I used the Cilantro and Tomato variety)
* 2 Tablespoons Cumin
* 2 Tablespoons Oregano
* 3 Bay leaves
* 4 Tablespoons finely chopped garlic
* 4 Dried red chili peppers, finely chopped (about 1 Tablespoon)
* 1/2 Cup oil
* 1/2 Cup white cooking wine
* 2 Limes

Instructions
------------
1. Mix dried chili peppers into the white wine and set aside.
2. In a large sauce pan over medium heat, sauté the onion and red peppers in the oil. When the onions are softened, mix in the garlic. sauté a few minutes, enough to mix the flavors.
3. Add the wine/chili mixture to the sauté. Let it cook for a minute or two. Add the black beans undrained to the sauté. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Mix in oregano, cumin, bay leaves, and Goya Sazon. Stir well until spices are evenly mixed. Let simmer for 2 minutes then transfer to a crock pot. Cook in crock pot on high setting for 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes.
5. Add lime juice, mix well, and serve over rice.

Notes
-----
1. I used the Cilantro and Tomato variety, but you can make a substitute by mixing the following. The amounts were not in the original recipe, so good luck!
   * Salt
   * Black Pepper
   * Garlic Powder
   * Ground Coriander
   * Cumin
   * Oregano
   * Paprika (or Annatto)
