----------
1. Halve and seed the peppers, then boil the halves for about 5 mins to soften them slightly and take away a tad of the heat.
2. In the meantime, mix all the other ingredients EXCEPT for the bacon and put the mix in the fridge for at least a half-hour. 
3. Drain peppers and cool on a towel. 
4. When cooled, fill each pepper with the cream cheese mixture then top with crumbled bacon. 
5. Bake at 350 &deg;F for about 15 mins or until bubbly. 

Storage
-------
Refrigerator for a few days, but if there are every any leftover (hardly ever), they are GREAT chopped up and put into scrambled eggs the next day.
