Recipes
=======
Literal recipes. Not for Chef, or Puppet, or Salt, or Python. Literally, recipes. For food. Because it's easier to keep track of them this way.

Forked from [mirrorscotty/recipes](https://github.com/mirrorscotty/recipes), because he had one or two I wanted to keep.

I'm also reorganizing it a bit, and probably cleaning up the ones that are already in here, just for my own preferences.
