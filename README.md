Recipes
=======
Literal recipes. Not for Chef, or Puppet, or Salt, or Python. Literally, recipes. For food. Because it's easier to keep track of them this way.

Forked from (https://github.com/mirrorscotty/recipes)[mirrorscotty/recipes], because he had one or two I wanted to keep.

I'm also reorganizing it a bit, and probably cleaning up the ones that are already in here, just for my own preferences. Each directory has a "New" sub-directory where unattempted recipes are kept. Most recipes will be in markdown and follow a similar layout.
