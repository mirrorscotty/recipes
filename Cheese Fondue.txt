Cheese Fondue

Ingredients
* 1/2 lb Swiss-style cheese such as Jarlsberg or Emmenthaler, shredded
* 1/2 lb Gruvere cheese, shredded
* 2 tbsp flour or cornstarch
* 1 garlic clove, halved crosswise
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp kirsch (cherry brandy)
* 1/2 tsp dry mustard
* Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
1. Place the shredded cheese and cornstarch in a plastic freezer bag. Seal and
shake to coat the cheese with the flour or cornstarch. Set aside.

2. Rub the incide of a 4 quart pot with the cut garlic, then discard. Add the
wine and lemon juice to the pot, and bring to a low simmer on medium heat. Bit
by bit, slowly stir the cheese intot he wine. Stir constantly in a zig-zag
pattern to prevent the cheese from seizing and balling up. Cook just until the
cheese is melty and creamy. Do not let boil. Once the mixture is smooth, stir
in the kirsch, mustard, and nutmeg.

3. Transfer the cheese to a fondue serving pot, set over low flame to keep
warm. If your pot is thin-bottomed, a lit candle will probably do. If the
thick-bottomed, you can use a small Sterno.
