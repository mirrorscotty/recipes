Mac and Cheese
==============

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 and 1/2 package of rice macaroni, cooked as directed, until just soft. (_See note 1_)
* 1 16 ounce package of sharp cheddar cheese-a full block of all-natural cheese, not pre-shredded.
* 4 ounces of cream cheese. (_see note 2_)
* 3 to 4 slices of all-natural cheddar cheese. (_see note 3_)
* 1 and 1/2 cups milk.

Directions
----------
1. Cook the pasta as directed, and drain. Rinse the pasta with cold water to remove extra starch. 
2. Shred the cheddar block using a food processor. 
3. Pour the pasta into a baking dish, add shredded cheese and stir. 
4. Soften cream cheese slightly in the microwave (20 to 30 seconds) and mix this into the pasta as well. 
5. Add milk. Top with sliced cheddar cheese. 
6. Bake at 350 &deg;F for 30 to 40 minutes, or until fully heated, with the cheese on top turning a bit golden brown.
7. Remove from oven and let set at least 5 minutes. Serve, and enjoy!

Notes
-----
1. I prefer Tinkyada brand. Don't overcook it if you can avoid it.
2. Store brands tend to have fewer ingredients in the cream cheese than national brands, and this is preferred. Check the labels.
3. Store brands are the best for this.
