Simple Ramen Noodles
====================
You will still need a broth to use.

These are not quite authentic, they are closer to egg noodles, but it still works well enough.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3/4 cups All Purpose Flour (_see note 1_)
* 1 egg
* 3/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
* 1 tablespoon water, depending on flour and humidity

Directions
----------
1. Mix the dry ingredients.
2. Make a well inside the dry ingredients, and beat the eggs and water inside.
3. Combine the ingredients together.
4. Once combined, dump onto clean counter and start kneading. Do **not** dust with flour.
   * The dough is ready when your hands become clean and the dough does not stick as much anymore.
   * When it is the right consistency, you should be able to lift your hand and the dough will fall off in about a second.
   * If it is too sticky, knead in some additional flour. If not sticky at all, add water a few drops at a time.
5. Wrap in a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on humidity.
6. Stretch to about 1 mm thickness in a rectangular-ish shape.
   * If it starts springing back to the original shape, let it rest for a few minutes.
7. Spread flour liberally on surface of a cutting board. Place stretched dough on top. Fold in half, twice, in same direction, spreading flour on the surface after each fold. Spread flour on top.
8. Begin bringing a pot of water with some salt to a boil.
9. Cut into thin noodles. Toy around with fingers to unfold, or toss around with more flour. Careful not to break them.
10. Sprinkle noodles into the water, a few at a time.
    * They will stick if you dump them in.
11. Mix around with chopsticks. If the water is hot enough, they will start to float.
12. Boil about 3-4 minutes, until they are just soft enough.
13. Add to broth and enjoy.


Notes
-----
1. If you can find low and high gluten flours, mix 1 part low to 2 parts high. (so 1/4 cup of low to 1/2 cup of high for this recipe)
2. This dough doubles or quadruples well, though becomes difficult to knead and manage.
