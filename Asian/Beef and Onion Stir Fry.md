=======================

Metadata
--------
Yield: 4 servings.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3-4 pounds of thin cut steak. (You'll need a number of packages-whatever looks best.)
* 2 onions, coarsely chopped
* Olive oil
* 3 Tablespoons Soy Sauce (_See Note 1_)
* 2-3 Tablesppons Corn starch
* 1 1/2 cups Rice

Directions
----------
1. Cook rice as directed. (_See note 2_)
2. Slice steak into strips, about 1/2 inch wide by 3-4 inches long. Remove extra fat and gristle. 
3. Pour olive oil into skillet, enough to coat the bottom of the pan. (Not a big puddle-just a coating.) 
4. Add steak, and cook over medium to high heat until meat is brown.
5. Add onions and soy sauce. 
6. Stir to coat meat with soy sauce. 
7. Cook on medium heat until onions are translucent. 
8. Add two to three tablespoons of corn starch to a bowl with a small amount of water. Stir until blended. 
9. Add corn starch and water mixture to stir fry. Stir until mixture thickens. 
10. Serve immediately over rice. Enjoy! 

Notes
-----
1. Alternatively, use a soy sauce substitue: 1-2 tablespoons of molasses, 1-2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar, and 1 teaspon of sugar. Add all of the ingredients at the same time to the skillet, instead of mixing before hand.
2. Generally, boil 2 parts water, add 1 part rice, and bring down to a simmer. When water is all absorbed, rice is done (usually about 15 minutes)
