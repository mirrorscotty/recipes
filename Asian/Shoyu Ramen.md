==========================

Source: [A Thousand Soups](http://www.athousandsoups.com/2008/11/guest-post-quick-and-easy-shoyu-ramen.html)

Ingredients
-----------
* 15-18 oz Chuka Soba cooked to package directions (_see note 1_)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
* 7 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* 1 cup water
* 3 tbsp mirin (_see note 2_)(or 3 tbsp sake + 1 tbsp sugar see notes for substitution)
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup chopped green onion
* shredded nori (optional)

Directions
----------
1. Put the water, chicken broth, soy sauce, garlic, mirin and ginger in a pot and bring it to a boil. 
2. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.
3. Put the cooked noodles into a bowl. Ladle the broth over the noodles to the desired amount.
4. Top with chopped green onion and shredded nori if desired.

Notes
-----
1. If you can not find Chuka Soba and don't want to make your own noodles, you could substitute the same amount of chow mein noodles (not the deep fried/crunchy ones) or thin spaghetti cooked slightly past the al dente stage.
2. You can substitute mirin with 3 tbsp sake + 1 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp sherry, or even just 3 tbsp sugar.
3. I was able to divide this recipe to 1/3 nicely, though the vegetable broth was strange.
