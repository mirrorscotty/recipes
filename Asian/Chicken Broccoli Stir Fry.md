Chicken Broccoli Stir Fry
=========================

Ingredients
-----------
* 12 boneless, skinless chicken breast. (_see note 1_)
* Blood orange olive oil, or regular olive oil.
* 2 packages frozen of broccoli cuts.
* 1 package of frozen broccoli florets.
* 1 package frozen sugar snap peas.
* 2 large cans of mandarin oranges. (_see note 2_)
* Rice. (_see note 3_)
* Corn starch or tapioca flour.

Directions
----------
1. Cook rice as directed. (_see note 3_)
2. Cut chicken breasts into approximately 1 inch cubes-not precise pieces-and remove all fat and gristle. 
3. Add olive oil to skillets to coat.
   * Two skillets are likely needed.
4. Start cooking chicken over medium heat, while microwaving veggies as directed. This usually takes about 7 minutes/pacakge.
   * As each package of veggies is done, pour the hot veggies into a large plastic bowl.
   * Keep cooking chicken until cooked through, as you continue to cook veggies.
5. Once chicken is cooked, turn off heat and finish cooking veggies. 
6. Drain the mandarin orange juice into a bowl or two.
7. Add veggies to skillets. Add one can of mandarin oranges, without the juice, to the top of each skillet. 
8. Turn on medium heat and stir to continue to heat through. Add salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
9. Add a couple tablespoons of thickening flour (corn starch or tapioca flour) to the bowl(s) with the mandarin orange juice.
10. Stir until mixed, then divide and add to skillets. 
11. Stir over heat until thickened. (_see note 4_)

Serve immediately over rice. 

Notes
-----
1. Use all natrual chicken, such as the Perdue brand, or purchased from a meat market
2. These cans are probably 14 ounces, and the store brands tend to have fewer ingredients.
3. Simple rice directions: Bring 2 parts water to boil. Add 1 part rice, reduce to simmer. Rice will be done when water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. 
4. You made need to add more thickening flour to the bowl(s) if the mixture does not thicken enough the first time through.
